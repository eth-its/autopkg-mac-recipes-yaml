Description: 
  Uploads the pkg to the JSS, and creates a Self-Service Policy available to members of a Testing group.
  If the license script is needed again for major version update, put the inputs and the processors back in place.
  This also has to be done in the -nodes and -prod recipes. In all three you have to change the policy template to one with a script.

    **GraphPad Prism**, available for both Windows and Mac computers, combines scientific graphing, comprehensive curve fitting (nonlinear regression), understandable statistics, and data organization.

    GraphPad Prism was originally designed for experimental biologists in medical schools and drug companies, especially those in pharmacology and physiology. Prism is now used much more broadly by all kinds of biologists, as well as social and physical scientists.  More than 200,000 scientists in over 110 countries rely on Prism to analyze, graph and present their scientific data. It is also widely used by undergraduate and graduate students.
