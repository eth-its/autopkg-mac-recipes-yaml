# Uninstall existing copy of Sophos 9.x by checking for the InstallationDeployer 
# application in the following locations:
#
# Sophos AV Cloud (saas), Sophos AV Home Edition (he),
# Sophos AV Standalone (opm-sa), Sophos AV Enterprise (opm)
# /Library/Application Support/Sophos/{edition}/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/
# /Library/Application Support/Sophos/{edition}/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/tools/
#
# If the InstallationDeployer application is present in the 
# Contents/MacOS/tools directory, the uninstallation process is run using the 
# InstallationDeployer tool located there.
#
# If the InstallationDeployer application is present only in the 
# Contents/MacOS directory, the uninstallation process is run using the 
# InstallationDeployer tool located there.
#
# The reason for the directory-specific check is that running the 
# InstallationDeployer application from Contents/MacOS on Sophos 9.1.x 
# and later will cause the Sophos uninstaller application to launch in the 
# dock and interfere with a normal installation via installer package.
#
# For more information, see the link below:
